# Front-end checklist:

-   [ ] Components should not overpass 200 lines for maintenance and testing purposes.
-   [ ] No inline `styles` for html elements. No style="text-align: center".
-   [ ] No `axios`(libraries which make http calls) calls directly on the components. Store or service/helper depending on the need. Use `http.ts` instead of using `axios` directly.
-   [ ] Code used in more than 2 files should be moved to a utility/helper and be shared.
-   [ ] Tested on mobile.
-   [ ] Tested in Chrome, Firefox, Safari.
